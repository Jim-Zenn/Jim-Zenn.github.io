      <description>When I left Shanghai for the US I was all on my own. I met new friends, got a new community, had a new life style and embraced a different culture. Everything was fresh. By the end the second year, I already see Berkeley as my second home.
Now I am back, to my real home, where my family is, where I grew up, where I spent 18 years of my life.</description>
