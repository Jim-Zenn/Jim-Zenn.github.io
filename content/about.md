I am a student of UCLA, majoring in Applied Mathematics.

 I currently work with AI Frontiers Conference. I am responsible for all of the conference's web development and digital marketing.

Before I was admitted to UCLA, I studied Computer Science at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). I was Vice President of Technology of HICA (HIT International Communication Association). I was responsible for the organization's technology operation and public communication, including website, tech development and branding. I also founded HICA's technology division HICA IO, which plays a key role in the continued development of HICA's website and branding.

I am a native of Shanghai, the Magic Capital of China.
