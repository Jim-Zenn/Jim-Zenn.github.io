I want to keep my notes, so that I can come back to see them again one day.

More importantly, why computer science courses can have those cool websites but math courses can't?

So I decided to make a course site with my notes and the site is so cool that makes all other course sites look like shit.

That's the idea.

For Math 115A, I decided to make this linear transformation demo that looks so very cool.
