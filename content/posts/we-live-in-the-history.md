We learn from history that we do not learn from history.<br>&rlm;<small>—— _Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel_</small>

Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. What happened in the 20th century is happening again in the 21st century.

Let's admit it. At least until now, "we the people" are not always wise. People are sentimental and do not always know what is good for the greater community. Whenever the economy suffers, the people demand change, and they mobilize. Nazi, Soviet, CCP, all rose during a depression. People do not care based on what beliefs the government operates, as long as the government brings prosperity, they cheer and adapts themselves to the belief.

This collective pragmatism stems from people's shortsightedness. It's hard to blame one for their shortsightedness, especially their life and their family's life is under threat of hunger. By Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, people simply do not have the ability to think beyond themselves.

I believe there is no need to elaborate on this conclusion, since there are numourous examples to prove this right. However, equality aside, is it poossible to reach a state of collective prosperity?

This is a problem all the governors has to solve, with full or half heart. Let me state the problem again with greater detail, that is: how to create general prosperity with limited resources? And here's a question that is proobably more important than the previous one, if such prosperity is achieved, will people be satisfied and be wise enough to sacrifice their own benefits for the greater good?

The dilema, I guess, is that there is simply not enough resources for everyone.

Even though the technology has leaped forward, it is still not advanced enough. In some parts of the world, people still suffers from famine.

Africa, North Korea?
