## Catalog Description

Techniques of proof, abstract vector spaces, linear transformations, and matrices; determinants; inner product spaces; eigenvector theory. P/NP or letter grading.

## Subject Information

Math 115A is a core mathematics subject required of all the various mathematics majors. The subject material can be regarded as an elaboration of the linear algebra already covered in Math 33A. However, the level of abstraction and the emphasis on proof technique make this a difficult subject for many students. Successful students emerge from the experience not only with a better understanding of linear algebra, but also with a higher level of mathematical maturity, better equipped to deal with abstract concepts.

The material covered in Math 115A includes linear independence, bases, orthogonality, the Gram-Schmidt process, linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and diagonalization of matrices. These topics are all covered in Math 33A though only in the context of Euclidean space. Topics in Math 115A that go beyond Math 33A include inner product spaces, adjoint transformations, and the spectral decomposition theorem for self-adjoint operators.

Three or four sections of Math 115A are offered each term. Also, an honors version Math 115AH runs parallel to Math 115A in some quarters. The content of Math 115AH is as follows:
Vector spaces, subspaces, basis and dimension, linear transformations and matrices, rank and nullity, change of basis and similarity of matrices, inner product spaces, orthogonality and, orthonormality, Gram-Schmidt process, adjoints of linear transformations and dual spaces, quadratic forms and symmetric matrices, orthogonal and unitary matrices, diagonalization of hermitian and symmetric matrices, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and their computation, exponentiation of matrices and application to differential equations, least squares problems, trace, determinant, canonical forms. Systems of linear equations: solvability criteria, Gaussian elimination, row-reduced form, LU decomposition.

## Textbook

(Listed textbook is the standard guideline. Please check the schedule of classes for the official textbook.)

Section 14.8 is the proof of the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem. This should probably be left for the Honors Section.
This is rather difficult, but it introduces summation by parts. Using summation by parts to prove Dirichlet's Test (and hence the Alternating Series Test) is an alternative to Abel's Theorem.
This is a lot, but Sections 17.1 is just a review of linear transformations and 17.2 and 17.3 contain only one theorem.

# Math 132: Complex Analysis for Applications

- **Site**: https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/subjects/math/132
- **Units**: 4 units
- **Lecture**: 3 hrs
- **Discussion**: 1hr
- **Requisites**: Math 32B, 33B

## Catalog Description

Introduction to basic formulas and calculation procedures of complex analysis of one variable relevant to applications. Topics include Cauchy/Riemann equations, Cauchy integral formula, power series expansion, contour integrals, residue calculus.

## Subject Information

The following schedule, with textbook sections and topics, is based on 26 lectures. The remaining classroom meetings are for leeway, reviews, and a midterm exam. These are scheduled by the individual instructor. Often there are a review and a midterm exam about the end of the fifth week of instruction, plus a review for the final exam.

**General Information**. Complex analysis is one of the most beautiful areas of pure mathematics, at the same time it is an important and powerful tool in the physical sciences and engineering. The subject Math 132 is aimed primarily at students in applied mathematics, engineering, and physics, and it is satisfies a major requirement for students in Electrical Engineering.

The topics covered in Math 132 include: analytic functions, Cauchy-Riemann equations, harmonic functions, branch points, branches of multiple-valued functions, Cauchy's theorem, integral representation formulae, power series of analytic functions, zeros, isolated singularities, Laurent series, poles, residues, use of residue calculus to evaluate real integrals, use of argument principle to locate zeros, fractional linear transformations, and conformal mapping.

Students entering Math 132 are assumed to have some familiarity with complex numbers from high school, including the polar form of complex numbers. Students in Math 132 are also assumed to have a strong background in single and multivariable calculus, including infinite series, power series, radius of convergence (ratio and root tests), integration term by term of power series, parametrized curves, line integrals, and Green's theorem. Some of this material is reviewed in Math 132, though at a fast pace.

Several sections of Math 132 are offered each term.

## Textbook

T. Gamelin, *Complex Analysis*, Springer/Verlag.

*The book is subject to change. Check with the UCLA Bookstore.

The students should be familiar with the elementary properties of complex numbers from high school. They have been introduced to the complex exponential function in Math 33B. They should be familiar with power series, including radius of convergence, the ratio and root tests, and integration term by term.

The idea of gluing sheets together at branch cuts to form a surface is important, but it can be omitted at this stage. At most it should be treated only at an intuitive level, to introduce the idea to the students and to arouse their interest.

The idea of conformality can be treated lightly if short on time. The results of the section on conformality are used primarily to see that fractional linear transformations map orthogonal circles to orthogonal circles.

With respect to uniform convergence, the only thing that is really needed is the Weierstrass M-test, together with the integration term by term of a uniformly convergent series of functions.

The material in Section VIII.1 on the argument principle is important to electrical engineers and should not be omitted. Rather omit Section VII.3 if short of time at the end of the subject.

Outline update: T. Gamelin, 3/04

NOTE: While this outline includes only one midterm, it is strongly recommended that the instructor considers giving two. It is difficult to schedule a second midterm late in the quarter if it was not announced at the beginning of the subject.

# Math 142: Mathematical Modeling

## Catalog Description

- **Site**: https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/subjects/math/142
- **Lecture**: 3 hrs
- **Discussion**: 1hr
- **Requisites**: Math 32B, Math 33B

Introduction to fundamental principles and spirit of applied mathematics. Emphasis on manner in which mathematical models are constructed for physical problems. Illustrations from many fields of endeavor, such as the physical sciences, biology, economics, and traffic dynamics.

## General Information

One section of Math 142 is offered each term. For the past several years the enrollments in the subject have run between 35 and 100 students each term.

# Math 170A: Probability Theory

## Catalog Description

- **Site**: https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/subjects/math/170A
- **Units**: 4 units
- **Lecture**: 3 hrs
- **Discussion**: 1hr
- **Requisites**: Math 32B, Math 33A

Probability distributions, random variables and vectors, expectation. P/NP or letter grading.

## General Information

Probability and stochastic processes are used to create and analyze models in a broad range of fields, including statistics, economics, finance, engineering, biology and physics. Mathematics 170AB and 171 are designed to give a firm foundation in this area for students who will work and/or do graduate work in one of these fields. They also provide an excellent background for graduate work in probability and related areas of mathematics.

These subjects are particularly well suited to students who plan to take the exams in actuarial science. The second exam in this series (number 110) is on probability and statistics. Mathematics 170AB covers roughly 2/3 of the material on that exam.

Subject 170A is multiply listed with Statistics. Usually, two sections are offered each Fall Quarter, one by Mathematics and one by Statistics. Total enrollment in the two sections tends to be about 50.

The three subjects are intended as a year-long sequence. However, it is possible, and not unusual, to take 171 without 170B. In fact, the enrollments in 171 are sometimes larger than in 170B (both are in the 10-20 range). Mathematics 170B is offered each Winter Quarter, and Mathematics 171 is offered each Spring.

## Textbook

*Introduction to Probability* by D. P. Bertsekas and John N. Tsitsiklis, 2nd edition

Comments:

The theoretical problems, which appear with full solutions at the ends of the chapters, are an essential part of the subject. Many of them should be incorporated into the lectures.

Unfortunately, solutions to all of the other problems are freely available on the book?s web site. Additional problems (with no posted solutions) are available at <http://www.athenasc.com/prob-supp.html>

# Math 170B: Probability Theory

- **Site**: https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/subjects/math/170B
- **Units**: 4 units
- **Lecture**: 3 hrs
- **Discussion**: 1hr
- **Requisites**: Math 170A

## Catalog Description

Convergence in distribution, normal approximation, laws of large numbers, Poisson processes, random walks. P/NP or letter grading.

##General Information

Probability and stochastic processes are used to create and analyze models in a broad range of fields, including statistics, economics, finance, engineering, biology and physics. Mathematics 170AB and 171 are designed to give a firm foundation in this area for students who will work and/or do graduate work in one of these fields. They also provide an excellent background for graduate work in probability and related areas of mathematics.

These subjects are particularly well suited to students who plan to take the exams in actuarial science. The second exam in this series (number 110) is on probability and statistics. Mathematics 170AB covers roughly 2/3 of the material on that exam.

Subject 170A is multiply listed with Statistics. Usually, two sections are offered each Fall Quarter, one by Mathematics and one by Statistics. Total enrollment in the two sections tends to be about 50.

The three subjects are intended as a year-long sequence. However, it is possible, and not unusual, to take 171 without 170B. In fact, the enrollments in 171 are sometimes larger than in 170B (both are in the 10-20 range). Mathematics 170B is offered each Winter Quarter, and Mathematics 171 is offered each Spring.

Comments:

(a) The theoretical problems, which appear with full solutions at the ends of the chapters, are an essential part of the subject. Many of them should be incorporated into the lectures. Some to emphasize are given in parentheses below.

(b) Unfortunately, solutions to all of the other problems are freely available on the book?s web site. Additional problems (with no posted solutions) are available at <http://www.athenasc.com/prob-supp.html>

# Math 164: Optimization

- **Site**: https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/subjects/math/164
- **Units**: 4 units
- **Lecture**: 3 hrs
- **Discussion**: 1hr
- **Requisites**: Math 115A, Math 131A

## Catalog Description

Fundamentals of optimization. Linear programming: basic solutions, simplex method, duality theory. Unconstrained optimization, Newton's method for minimization. Nonlinear programming, optimality conditions for constrained problems. Additional topics from linear and nonlinear programming. P/NP or letter grading.

## Subject Information:

The following schedule, with textbook sections and topics, is based on 27 lectures. The remaining classroom meetings are for leeway, reviews, and a midterm exam. These are scheduled by the individual instructor.

**General Information**. Math 164 provides an introduction to the theory and algorithms concerned with finding extrema (maxima and minima) of functions subject to constraints.

After a review of topics from multivariable calculus such as the gradient, Hessian, Jacobian, Taylor series, and linear algebra, the subject offers the students a working knowledge of optimization theory and methods for linear and nonlinear programming, that is, how to find extrema of linear and nonlinear functions subject to various kinds of constraints.

There are ample opportunities for the students to improve their ability to read and write mathematical proofs as well as to solve applied and theoretical problems.
