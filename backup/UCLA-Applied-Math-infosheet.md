This page is a catch-all infosheet for UCLA applied math students like me. This page collected the requirements for students to declare the major and to graduate. It also has information on optional challenges, specifically: *specialization in computing*, *statistics minor*, and *department honor program*.

Because there are simply too much information, I am not able to list all the sources from which I collected these information, but all infomation in this article does come from UCLA's official websites. Still, there can be things that I accidentally left out or mistaken. You can use this as a reference, but do not rely solely on this page.

If you notice any error in this page, please contact me and let me know.

# Applied Mathematics

## General Education

1. All UCLA students must complete a GE curriculum pattern.
2. As a transfer student, you may have fulfilled this with IGETC.

I am the second case. Therefore, I would not list the GE requirements here, and I'll simply give you links to related pages that you may find useful.

Related pages:

## Pre-Major Subjects (10)

**Mathematics sequenced subjects** (Math 31A - 33B, hereinafter MSC) are calculated separately from the other preparation for the major subjects, and must be completed with a <u>minimum overall 2.5 GPA and a grade of “C” or better in each subject</u>.

Repetition of more than two MSC or of any MSC more than once results in automatic dismissal from the major. In other words, you only have one chance to repeat a MSC.

To declare, finish following 10 subjects.

To be considered for admission to the Honors Program in Applied Mathematics, a student must:

- be officially enrolled in the Applied Mathematics major;
- have completed at least four subjects at UCLA in the Mathematics Department from those required in the "Preparation for the Major" or Major; and
- have at least a 3.6 GPA in such mathematics subjects taken at UCLA.

## Requirements

The student must have completed,

| Dept.     | No.   | Name                                                         | Units  |

**AND** One of the following three quarter sequences:

- Mathematics 151AB and any subject 152-159;
- 170AB and 171;
- Statistics 100ABC; or
- 3 from Mathematics 134, 135, 136, 146.

(Other appropriate subjects may be substituted for this requirement upon approval of the Honors Committee.)

2. The student must either:

- submit an original project as described below; or
- take, as an approved active participant, any upper division or graduate seminar offered by the Department of Mathematics.  Such participation is described below.

3. The student must have a GPA of at least 3.6 in upper division mathematics and statistics subjects taken for the major.

**Original Project:**

- The project should involve some aspects of mathematical theory.
- The project is to be carried out under the sponsorship of a faculty advisor.
- The project may be done as part of a regular subject, a special subject (Mathematics 199), Summer REU project or by a special arrangement.
- **No later than one quarter prior to graduation, the student must submit a project proposal to the Honors Committee for approval.  The project itself must be submitted not later than the fifth week of the last quarter before graduation.**
- The Honors Committee will evaluate the project in consultation with the faculty sponsor, and may at it's discretion, require a personal presentation by the student.

**Seminars:**

Approval as an active participant requires all of the following:

- two lectures;
- a written statement, signed by the instructor, describing the nature of the participation.  This statement must be submitted to the Honors Committee no later than the end of the quarter in which the seminar is given or the fifth week of the last quarter before graduation, whichever is sooner;
- approval of the Honors Committee.
- Upper division seminars in Mathematics automatically count as mathematics electives for the major.

## Highest Honors

In addition to the above:

- Students who demonstrate exceptional achievement will be awarded Highest Honors.
- Decisions regarding projects, seminar participation, and Highest Honors will be made by the Honors Committee.

<small>This Honors Program is independent of the honors sections of the mathematics subjects.  Graduation with Honors in Mathematics is also distinct from graduation with College Honors.  Applications for the Honors Program in Mathematics are available in the Student Services Office, 6356 Math Sciences.  If you have any questions about the program, or special requests, you are welcome to consult any members of the Mathematics Honors Committee, or see an Undergraduate Mathematics Counselor in 6356 Math Sciences.</small>
