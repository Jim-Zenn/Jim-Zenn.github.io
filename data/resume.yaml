"Projects":
  -
    name: "Parallel Computing"
    year: 2018
    skills: ["CUDA", "ISPC"]
    descriptions:
      - Followed through the course’s lectures and completed the assignments.
      - Knows how to utilize multiple threads / cores to optimize programs with ISPC or CUDA.
  -
    name: "Scheme Inteerpreter"
    year: 2017
    skills: ["Python", "Scheme"]
    descriptions:
      - A scheme interpreter with lexical and syntactical analysis, evaluation and application.
      - Optimized the interpreter with tail call optimation, so that tail recursions are executed like normal iteration.
      - Implemented call/cc special form (i.e. call-with-current-continuation), allowing a scheme procedure to keep a status snapshot and come back later. (Similar to Python’s generator)
      - Impremented define-macro special form, make it possible to use a pre defined macro to create a new procedure.
  - 
    name: "Object Tracking and Following"
    year: 2015
    descriptions:
      - A camera that identifies, tracks, and follows the object (by turning the camera).
      - Used OpenCV to identify and track am specific item in a complex background.
      - Programed the camera motors so that the camera can contineuously capture the object while it moves.
