      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not trying to accuse anyone. Here, I only want to talk about my memories of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a firm materialist. Because of this, I always thought tombs unnecessary, since one&amp;rsquo;s spirit is unlikely to exist after their decease. The dead need no places to rest. Death is void and eternal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>When I left Shanghai for the US I was all on my own. I met new friends, got a new community, had a new life style and embraced a different culture. Everything was fresh. By the end the second year, I already see Berkeley as my second home.
Now I am back, to my real home, where my family is, where I grew up, where I spent 18 years of my life.</description>
